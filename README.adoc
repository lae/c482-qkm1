= C482 - Inventory Management System

This is a JavaFX application developed for the performance assessment for C482 -
Software I at Western Governor's University. It is written in spec to the
version of the curriculum that uses Java 11 (in use in September 2020).

You can use this as a learning utility (I don't exactly write Java for a living
though) but please refrain from copy-pasting or otherwise reusing portions of
this code as-is within your assessment.
